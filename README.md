# Basic-Website

HTML (Structure)
Navigation Bar (<nav>): 
A top menu with links to sections like Home, About, Services, and Sign Up. 
It includes a responsive "hamburger" icon for mobile view.

  Page Sections:
    
    #home – A hero banner with a headline, tagline, and a call-to-action button.
    
    #about – Describes the business's purpose and offerings.
    
    #services – Displays services in a card-style layout.
    
    #sign-up – Encourages visitors to join or register.
  
  Footer: Contains extra links and social media icons.
  
    JavaScript (Functionality)
      Mobile Menu Toggle (mobileMenu)
      Shows or hides the navigation links on smaller screens when the hamburger icon is clicked.
      
      Scroll-Based Menu Highlight (highlightMenu)
      Highlights the active menu item depending on the scroll position — only on larger screens (above 960px).
      
      Close Mobile Menu on Click (hideMobileMenu)
      Automatically closes the mobile navigation when a menu item or the site logo is clicked — useful on mobile devices.
  
  Main Purpose
    To create a responsive, single-page website that:
    
    Adapts to different screen sizes,
    
    Highlights the current section while scrolling,
    
    Provides a clean, mobile-friendly user experience.
